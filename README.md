# Chess
This source was developed by two college students as a final project for a class.

### Values
- Simplicity
Not way too many interdependent classes, simple interfaces for anyone to extend from.
- Modularity
You can make your own pieces, board layouts, and entire gamemodes. If you use this code base, you can experiment with Chess to its fullest!
